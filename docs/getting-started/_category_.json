    "description": "TCAdmin is a server panel designed for dedicated servers, requiring administrator or root level permissions to install and run. The panel's documentation provides detailed instructions for installation and upgrades, emphasizing the importance of reading and understanding it. The panel is not a simple drag-and-drop service but a sophisticated system with dependencies, requiring administrators to invest time and effort in learning its functionalities. It is recommended to have basic knowledge of Linux or Windows system administration for a positive and successful experience. Alternative options should be considered if unfamiliar with these concepts. The goal is to support users in achieving successful outcomes."
