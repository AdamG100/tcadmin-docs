## Manual Update

:::warning
It is recommended to perform a manual update only in two scenarios: when a new remote server has been added or when the web update process has failed. The web update ensures that your database is updated before updating the files. Neglecting to update the database while updating may result in TCAdmin failing to start or encountering unpredictable errors.
