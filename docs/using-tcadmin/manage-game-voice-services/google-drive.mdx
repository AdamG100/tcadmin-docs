# Google Drive

The TCAdmin file manager allows users to backup their files to Google Drive. These backups are stored within the user's Google account. The administrator's Google account is only required to activate the service on the domain.

When backing up and restoring files using the TCAdmin file manager, the system applies the game's file system permissions. This means that if a user has permission to read a file, they can back it up to Google Drive. Similarly, if a user has permission to create a file, they can restore it from the backup.

Furthermore, the TCAdmin file manager provides configuration options to customize access to this feature for specific games. Administrators can choose which games have access to the backup functionality. Additionally, they can set upload and download limits, allowing them to control the amount of data being transferred.

In summary, the TCAdmin file manager enables users to conveniently backup their files to Google Drive, with the backups stored in their own Google account. The system leverages the game's file system permissions for backing up and restoring files. Administrators have control over access to this feature for different games and can set upload and download limits as needed.

## Requirements

- Your control panel must be accessible using a domain or subdomain. Direct IP access is not supported by Google.
- If you don't have a domain you can do a reverse DNS lookup on your control panel's IP and use that hostname (if it has one). [https://www.whatismyip.com/reverse-dns-lookup/](https://www.whatismyip.com/reverse-dns-lookup/)

## Limitations

- TCAdmin can only restore files created by your control panel. It can't read other files in the client's Google Drive.
- If you delete the Google project and create a new one TCAdmin will not be able to read backups created with the previous project.
