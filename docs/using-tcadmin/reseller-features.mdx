# Reseller Features

Administrators can create reseller packages. These packages allows users to create their own game, voice and Teamspeak services and assign them to their own users.

You can't have a reseller with both packages and assigned servers or Teamspeak servers. For example if a reseller has a package for creating game servers and you assign him a Teamspeak server it can cause unexpected results.

:::note
The billing API for resellers only supports packages. It does not support creating services on assigned servers or Teamspeak servers.

## Billing API Support for Administrators

Administrators can automate reseller packages with the billing API. Only 2 parameters are required:

- `role_id` - The id of the reseller role that will be assigned to new resellers.
- `package_id` - The id of the reseller package that will be assigned to the reseller account.

If you use the `tcadmin2_advanced` module for WHMCS create a copy of default_values.php and set the values of `role_id` and `package_id` as required. When you configure your reseller product in WHMCS, set the value of Config File to the new one that you created.

For more information on using the WHMCS module read the [tcadmin2_advanced documentation](#).

## Billing API Support for Resellers

Resellers can automate their own services using the billing api the same way and administrator would. For more information on using the WHMCS module read the [tcadmin2_advanced documentation](#).
