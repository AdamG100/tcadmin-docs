# SteamCmd

## Configure TCAdmin to use SteamCmd

### Configure the game

- Go to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `Games` > `Select the game` > `Select the Steam Settings` tab.
- Select "Enabled (steamcmd)"
- Enter the steam app id of the game's **dedicated server**. Specify a steam account if needed. You can find a list of application ids here: [Steam_Application_IDs](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Application_IDs)
- Select the Feature Permissions tab
- Enable Steam Update for all user types.
- Save

### Configure the Steam Account used by TCAdmin

- Go to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `Default Steam Settings`
- Enter your Steam account user and password. It is recommended that you set the default user to `anonymous` with a blank password. If a game requires a different account specify it in the game's settings.
- Save

### Download the Game Files

You can download the game's files by going to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `Game Tools`. Select the `Steam Game Downloader tool`. Select the game and the server where the files will be downloaded, then execute the task. The first time steamcmd is used TCAdmin will attempt to install it.

For troubleshooting follow the instructions below.

### Updating a service

After following the previous instructions you should be able to select a game server and click on Steam Update to update the game files.

## Steam Guard Activation

If you have Steam Guard enabled on your account, the first time you use the SteamCmd features in TCAdmin you will receive an email with the Steam Guard code. Follow these instructions to use that code.

  cd C:\TCAFiles\Users\SteamCmd
  steamcmd.exe +login YOUR-STEAM-ACCOUNT
  ```

## Configure Steam Update Notifications

- Go to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `Default Steam Settings`. Enter your Steam API key. You can get a free API key from [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
- Go to Settings > Games > Select the Game > Steam Settings. Enter the value for Store Id (for Steam API). Get this id from the game's URL.

:::info example
if the URL to the game is [http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/) set this value to 4000.
:::

- If all goes well you should see an update notification when you select the game server.
- Enabling this option also allows you to configure the Steam Update scheduled task to check if an update is available before running the update. This prevents unnecessary restarts.
- If you are using MVC templates go to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Setting`s > `Plugin Repository` > and install the module named `Steam Badges`.

:::note
When you enable this option for the first time all game servers will say there is an update available because the game server's current version is not saved. Run the steam update and the message will go away.

### A Steam Engine Instance already exists
Steamcmd on Linux does not allow multiple instances like it does on Windows. Wait until the other update has completed and try again.

### Failed to create directory `/steam/SteamApps`

Rename `/Steam/SteamApps` to `/steam/SteamApps`

### Referenced character was not allowed in XML. `Normalization is True, checkCharacters = True Line 21, position 40.`

Go to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `Default Steam Account`. Set the account to `anonymous` with a `blank password`.
