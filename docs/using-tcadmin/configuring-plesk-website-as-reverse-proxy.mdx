# Configuring a Plesk website as a reverse proxy for the control panel

- Login to Plesk
- Select your domain
- Select Apache & nginx Settings
- Uncheck `Proxy mode`
- Click on Apply **(this is important before continuing)**
- Set "Additional nginx directives" to the following. Replace `x.x.x.x:8881` with your control panel's IP and secure port.

```js showLineNumbers
location / {
    proxy_pass https://x.x.x.x:8881;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    client_max_body_size 0;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    proxy_buffering off;
}
```

If `Last login` shows the incorrect IP

- Go to `servers` > `master` > `website settings`.
- Set `Web Proxy IP` to the IP that is shown.
- Set `Web Proxy IP Header` to `X-Real-IP`.
- Save and select `Tools` > `Restart monitor`.
- After the control panel has been restarted you need to log out and log in twice so it shows your real IP.
