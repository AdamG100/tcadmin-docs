#### TCAdmin has the following security features:

- Password rules (minimum length, number of uppercase, numeric and alphanumeric characters).
- Limit admin and sub admin login to specific IPs or hostnames. If you have a dynamic IP you can use services like [no-ip.com](https://no-ip.com) and [dyn.com](https://dyn.com) to create a hostname that automatically updates with your IP.
