# Map Packs

The map pack installer allows the user to install one or more map files. You can either list all the files in the TCA.Maps folder or create single [compressed](/misc/compression) file with maps.

- `Name` - Specify the name shown to the user.
- `Comments` - Comments for this map pack.
- `Type` - Specify the type of map pack that you want to create.
  - `Compressed map files` : A single [compressed](/misc/compression) file that contains more than one map.
  - `Map file list` : Allows the user to select from a list of files in the TCA.Maps folder.
- `File` - If `Compressed map files` is selected, specify name of the compressed file that contains the maps. The file should be placed in `GameFiles\GameFolder\TCA.Maps\`
- `Extract Path` - If `Compressed map files` is selected, specify the path relative to the game server's root directory where the file will be extracted.
- `File Extensions` - If `Map file list` is selected, specify the extensions of the map files. The files should be placed in `GameFiles\GameFolder\TCA.Maps\` You can specify more than one extension by separating with ';'. For example: `*.pk3;*.bsp`
- `Copy Path` - If `Map file list` is selected, specify the path relative to the game server's root directory where the files will be copied.
- `Extract files` - If "Map file list" is selected, specify if the files with supported compression formats will be extracted. This is useful if a single map requires more than one file.

:::info example
A single Counter-Strike map has a `.bsp` file, a `.res` file and `.mdl` files.
