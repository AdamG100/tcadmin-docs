- `Relative Working Dir` - The relative path to the game's working directory. This is usually the folder where the game's executable is located. Leave blank to set the game root as the working directory. For example `bin`.
- `Relative Sub Admin Files` - The relative path to the folder that the sub administrators are given access to read and write files. Leave blank to give access to the game root. For example `maps`.
- `Relative Reseller Files` - The relative path to the folder that the reseller is given access to read and write files. Leave blank to give access to the game root. For example `maps`.
- `Relative User Files` - The relative path to the folder that the user is given access to read and write files. Leave blank to give access to the game root. For example `maps`.
- `Files Folder Name` - The name of the folder or zip/rar that contains the game files used for auto setup. This file or folder should be located in the server's Game Files Path folder.
