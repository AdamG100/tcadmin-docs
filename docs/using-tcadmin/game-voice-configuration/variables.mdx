# Variables

Variables are an important part of TCAdmin. They allow you to set predefined values for specific elements (e.g. settings in a configuration file) or the command line. You can also use variables in custom scripts.
If you want to use a variable in a configuration file or the commandline, you should use `$[DefaultVariableName]` or `![CustomVariable]`.
If you want to use a variable in a custom script, please see the documentation for [ThisService](/customizations/scripts/script-objects/this-service#custom-variables).

## Default Variables
All services have a few default variables configured. Some of these could be for the hostname, rcon password and private password.

## Custom Variables
You can create your own variables for each of your game templates. This is done under the "Variables" tab in the game settings.

- `Variable Name` - The unformatted name of the variable. You should not change the name if this variable is already in use.
- `Default Value` - The default value for this variable. `For example 'changeme'.`

### Commandline Parameter Options

- `Admin/Sub admin/Reseller/User/Server owner access` - Specify if the given role is able to set the value of this variable when using the commandline builder or executing a custom script.
- `Value is required` - Specify if the value is required.
- `Item Type` - Select the type of item that will be used to capture the user's input.
- `Parent Variable` - Select the item's parent value.
- `Parent Value` - The item will only be displayed if the parent variable has this value.

### Display formatting
Starting from TCAdmin 2.0.187.5, you have the ability to manipulate how a specific variable is shown to the user.
This is done using the 'Display Regex' and 'Display Format' fields.

The following is an example on how you could manipulate the value of a ComboBox that is generated based on folders in `backups/worlds/` on the game service.
The folders inside `backups/worlds/` are named based on the date and time they were created (%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S):
- 2023-08-27_220030
- 2023-08-27_100030
- 2023-08-26_220030

If you want to manipulate how this is shown in the ComboBox, you can use regex to change how the values are shown:
**Display Regex**: (\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})_(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})
**Display Format**: $1 $2:$3:$4

The above will result in the following formatting:
- 2023-08-27 22:00:30
- 2023-08-27 10:00:30
- 2023-08-26 22:00:30

The actual value of the variable is not affected by the formatting.
