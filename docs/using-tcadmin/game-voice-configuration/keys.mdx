# Keys

If the game requires a key to run you can configure them under the Keys icon. To use in the commandline or configuration file use the `$[Service.GameKey]` variable.

- `Key` - Specify the key used for this game.
- `Server` - Select the server where this key will be used. Leave blank to use the key on any server. If the specified server is deleted, the keys are also deleted.
- `Hide` - Specify if this key is hidden when used in the command line.
- `Reusable` - Specify if the key can be reused. If unchecked, the key will be deleted when the game service is deleted.
- `Assigned` - Specifies if the key is currently assigned to a service.
