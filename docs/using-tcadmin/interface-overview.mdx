Most grids can be personalized. You can sort rows by field value, `add/remove/resize/reorder` columns, group by values and change the number of rows shown per page. These settings can be saved so next time you visit the page it will restore your personalization. Rows can be exported to Excel, Word and plain text formats.

- To sort by field value simple click on the column header. Click again to reverse the order.
- To add or remove columns select `Grid Settings` > `Configure Columns.` `Check/unchecked` the desired columns and click on Apply.
- To resize a column, drag the column label's border from the left or right.
- To reorder a column, drag by the column label to the left or right.
- To group rows with similar values simply drag the column label to the space above it.
- To change the number of rows per page select a new value next to Page size.
