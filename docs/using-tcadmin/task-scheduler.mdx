# Task Scheduler

The Task Scheduler is a component that enables the scheduling of program or script launches at predetermined times. Whenever a service is created, reinstalled, or deleted, an associated task is automatically generated.

These tasks can be individualized to run once or may have already been executed. To manually initiate a task, simply select it and click on the Start button. If a previously failed task is started, it will resume from the point where the error occurred.

## Recurring Tasks

These tasks are user-defined and designed to run either once or multiple times. When a recurring task is created, it automatically generates a scheduled task that executes at the specified time. Upon executing the scheduled task, a new scheduled task is created based on the recurrence pattern defined for the original task.

### Schedule

- `One Time` - The task will only run once at the specified time. If the task has already executed you can schedule it again simply by updating the start time.
- `Daily` - The task will run once a day at the specified time. It can also be configured to run every other day, every 3 days, etc by using the `recur every x days` field.
- `Weekly` - The task will run every week on the specified days and time. It can also be configured to run every other week, every 3 weeks, etc by using the `recur every x weeks` field.
- `Monthly` - The task will run on the selected months on the specified days and time.

### Actions

Each recurring task can have one or more actions that execute on the specified server. If one action fails the task execution will be cancelled and set to error status.

### Action Chaining

Some actions can work with the results from previous actions.

:::info example
you can configure a task that does the following:

- Backup the database
- Compress the database backup file
- Upload the compressed file to an FTP server
