# Support System

The support system can be configured by administrators and resellers. A reseller can have his own configuration except for the global settings (enable attachments, allowed extensions, size limit).

## Configuration

### General Settings

- `Enabled` - Enable or disable the built in support ticket system.
- `Assign ticket to the first admin/subadmin that reads it` - If enabled, the ticket will be assigned to the first admin or sub admin that reads it. If the subadmin has `Unassign own tickets` and `Assign tickets` permission he can assign it to a different admin/subadmin.
- `Delete tickets when user is deleted` - Deletes all the user's tickets when the user is deleted.
- `Display Name` - The name shown to the user in the ticket's history.
- `Auto Close Tickets` - Specify the number of days to wait before the ticket is closed automatically after it has been answered. Set to 0 to disable. This requires the that the admin configure a recurring task with the `Auto close support tickets `action.

### Global Settings

- `Enable attachments` - Enable or disable attachments.
- `Allowed Extensions` - The allowed extensions separated by `";"`
- `Max Upload Size` - The maximum file size in KB that can be uploaded. Set to 0 to have no limit. Default is 5MB.

### Support Departments

Create your support ticket departments. You can specify the sub admins that have access to each department.

### Configure the Recurring Task

The admin needs to configure a recurring task that executes the `Auto close support tickets` action. Only the admin needs to configure a recurring task. The same task also processes the reseller's support tickets.

To create the recurring task go to `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `(under Task Scheduler category)` > `Recurring Tasks` > `New`.

- `Name` - Enter a name for the task.
- `Type` - Select Daily.
- `Start` - Enter the date of the first time you want the task to execute. Select tomorrow's date. Set the time when the task will be executed.
- `Recur Every` - Leave the value to 1 day.

Select the Actions tab. Click on New. Set the action to `Auto close support tickets`. Click on Apply, then on Save.

### Configure Sub Admin Access

Access to the support system is configured in the sub admin roles. Go to `User Management` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Roles` > S`elect the sub admin role`. Under the Support System category you will see the following permissions.

- `View assigned tickets` - The sub admin can view support tickets assigned to him.
- `View all tickets` - The sub admin can view all support tickets.
- `Change ticket options` - The sub admin can change the support ticket's options.
- `Open tickets` - The sub admin can create new support tickets.
- `Close tickets` - The sub admin can close support tickets.
- `Re-open tickets` - The sub admin can re-open support tickets that are currently closed.
- `Delete tickets` - The sub admin can delete support tickets.

### Configure Sub User Access

Sub user access to support tickets requires permissions from the `admin/reseller` and from the sub user's owner.

First the admin must allow a sub user access to the support system. This is configured in the user's role. Go to `User Management` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Roles` > `Select the user role`. Under the Support category enable `Sub users can create support tickets`.

With the previous permission enabled, the user can now enable access to his sub user. Select the sub user. In the Support Permissions you will see the following options.

- `View support tickets` - The sub user can view existing support tickets
- `Create/update support tickets` - The sub user can create and update support tickets.

### Mail Templates

You can find the mail templates used by the support system in `System` (on the left-hand navigation) > `Settings` > `Mail Templates` > `Support category`.
