# Two-Step Verification

## Configuration

- Install an authenticator app on your smartphone. You may use other OTP software or hardware.

[Authy Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en&gl=US) | [Authy IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twilio-authy/id494168017)

[Google authenticator Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US) | [Google authenticator IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)

If you want to enable two-step for FTP access check `Enable two-step verification for FTP connections.`

:::tip
If you enable this option configure your FTP client to send the password in the following format: `YourPassword#GeneratedToken`
:::

:::tip
If your software has scanning capabilities you can scan the QR-code.
:::

- Type the verification key in your Authenticator app or other software/hardware.
- Generate a token and type it in the "Generated Token" field.
- Click on Save.

## Common Errors

#### All generated tokens are expired

The token is generated based on the current time and is valid for 30 seconds. This required that both the client and server have the correct time.

:::tip
Use NTP to synchronize your date and time on the server:

#### User lost their verification key

You can disable two-step verification by selecting the user, select the `Actions` tab and click on `Disable two-step.` If the action is not visible it means the user doesn't have two-step authentication enabled.

#### Admin lost their verification key

Start the monitor in console mode. Execute this command in the console:

```
disable-two-step Admin
```
