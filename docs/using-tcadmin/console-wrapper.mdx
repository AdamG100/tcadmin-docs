# Console Wrapper

`TCAdminConsoleWrapper.exe` reads the output of a console application without redirecting. This is useful if the process crashes with 'Control console's output' enabled. Make sure 'Control console's output' is disabled in the game settings.

## Usage:

- Copy `TCAdminConsoleWrapper.exe` from `Program Files\TCAdmin2\Monitor\Tools` to the game server's folder. You may use an additional game script to do this.
- Create this batch script for the after started event with `Execute as the service's user` checked.

```bash
start TCAdminConsoleWrapper.exe -pid=%ThisService_Pid% -output=console.log -followcursor -max
```

- In the game's web console configuration:
  - Web Console Output Source: Log file
  - Log File: console.log
  
- If the game allows writing commands in the console:
  - Web Console Input Source: Console commands

Save and click on update existing services.

You can run `TCAdminConsoleWrapper.exe` without a command line to see all available parameters.
