# Billing API Examples

These pages post information to billingapi.aspx to create, suspend, activate and delete game servers.

- You can post information from code with php using the curl commands.
- Don't use these pages directly in your application because everybody will be able to see your TCAdmin login.
- In the sample pages configure the form to post to your billingapi.aspx by changing this:

```
action="http://127.0.0.1:8880/Aspx/billingapi.aspx"
```
