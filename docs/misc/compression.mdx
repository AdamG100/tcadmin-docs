# Compression

The following file formats and extensions are supported. No additional software is required.

### Windows and Linux

- `.zip`
- `.rar`

### Linux Only

- `Tarball` : `.tar`
- `Gzip compressed tarball`: `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`
- `BZip compressed tarball` : `tar.bz2`, `.tbz2`
- `Lzma compressed tarball` : `.tar.lzma`, `.tlz`

## Compressed Game Files

Game files can be compressed to improve transfer speed between servers. The compressed file should not include the `TCA.*` sub folders.

### Linux

First make sure the game's folder is not empty. You can run the compress scripts located in `/home/tcadmin/tcafiles/games`. The file name is `compress_<game>.sh`. If you run the compress script and the folder is empty it will create an empty file.

This example compressed the files for Counterstrike.

```bash title="cd to path"
cd /home/tcadmin/tcafiles/games
```

```bash title="execute sh script"
./compress_cs-linux.sh
```

### Windows

- Go to `C:\TCAFiles\Games\<game>`. Select all files and folders except the `TCA.*` folders.
- To compress the files to ZIP right click on the selected files and select `Send To` > `Compressed (zipped) Folder`. Move the created zip file to` C:\TCAFiles\Games`. Name it `<game>.zip`
- If you have Winrar installed right click on the selected files and select Add To > `<game>.rar`. Move the created rar file to `C:\TCAFiles\Games`.
