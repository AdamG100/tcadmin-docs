# Recommended Registry Changes

These registry changes adjust the memory available for desktop heaps created by non-interactive services. This resolves start errors that may happen on some servers a few days after a reboot.

## Windows 2008/2012/2016/2019/2022

Open the Registry (regedit.exe) and go to:

```
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management
```

And adjust two keys:

```
SessionPoolSize (this is 4 by default, put it to be 10 - remember, 10 as hexadecimal)
SessionViewSize (this is 30 by default, put it to 80 - again, hexadecimal)
```

Go to:

```
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SubSystems
```

Double-click on the Windows key. What is important (and the only thing that gets changed for that matter) is

```
SharedSection=1024,20480,2048
```

Close the registry and reboot the server for changes to take affect.
