# User Assigned Servers

## Overview

TCAdmin allows you to assign a server or a Teamspeak server to a user or reseller. When a user or reseller has one or more servers assigned he will be able to create game and voice servers on his own servers.

## Limitations

You should not give `root/administrator` access to the server. If you must provide access it is recommended you configure it as a stand alone master instead.

Servers assigned to a user or reseller are not used by the billing API.

A reseller can't have a mix of packages and assigned servers. This will cause unexpected results.

## Licensing

Enterprise licenses are limited to 10 user assigned servers or dedicated reseller packages. To increase the limit add a leased or purchased remote to your master license.
