# Linux FAQ

## Configure the Website on Port 80

By default, the TCAdmin website user runs with a normal account, and normal users can't open ports lower than 1024. To work around this limitation, you can redirect port 80 to 8880 using iptables.

**Q1.** How can I configure the website to run on port 80 on Linux?

**A1.** To configure the TCAdmin website to run on port 80, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your Linux server.

2. Use the following command to redirect incoming traffic from port 80 to port 8880 using iptables:
   ```bash
   iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8880
   ```

   If your server has more than one IP, and you want to redirect on a specific IP, use this command, replacing `1.2.3.4` with your server's IP address:
   ```bash
   iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 80 -d 1.2.3.4 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8880
   ```

3. After making the changes, save your iptables settings. Use one of the following commands, depending on your Linux distribution:

   For CentOS:
   ```bash
   service iptables save
   ```

   For Debian/Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   iptables-save
   ```

4. You have successfully configured the TCAdmin website to run on port 80, and incoming traffic will be redirected to port 8880.

**Q2.** How can I redirect port 21 to port 8821 for FTP?

**A2.** To redirect port 21 to port 8821 for FTP, you can use a similar iptables command:

```bash
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 21 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8821
```

This command will redirect FTP traffic from port 21 to port 8821.

## Enable HTTPS for the Control Panel Website

**Q3.** How can I enable HTTPS for the control panel website on Linux?

**A3.** To enable HTTPS for the control panel website on Linux, follow these steps:

1. Open the file `/home/tcadmin/Monitor/tcadmin-config` for editing.

2. Add the following line to the file to specify the secure web port (e.g., 8881):
   ```bash
   SECURE_WEB_PORT="8881"
   ```

3. Open the necessary port in your firewall to allow HTTPS traffic. You can use a command like `firewall-cmd` to do this.

4. After making these changes, restart the monitor service:
   ```bash
   /home/tcadmin/Monitor/monitor-service restart
   ```

Now, the control panel website should be accessible over HTTPS on the specified port.

## Use a Custom SSL Certificate (Linux)

**Q4.** How can I use a custom SSL certificate for the control panel website on Linux?

**A4.** To use a custom SSL certificate for the control panel website on Linux, follow these steps: [Create a self signed certificate](/customizations/web-server-configurations/setting-up-nginx#create-a-self-signed-certificate-optional)

This should allow you to use a custom SSL certificate for the control panel website.

## Configure the TCAdmin Website to Run with Nginx

**Q5.** How can I configure the TCAdmin website to run with Nginx on Linux?

**A5.** To configure the TCAdmin website to run with Nginx on Linux, follow the instructions provided in the article titled [Setting Up Nginx With TCAdmin](/customizations/web-server-configurations/setting-up-nginx)

## File Visibility Issues in FTP or File Manager

**Q6.** Some/all files are not visible in FTP or the file manager. How can I resolve this issue?

**A6.** By default, TCAdmin protects files with execute permissions. Only files that require execute permissions should have them. To remove execute permissions from a single file, use the following command:

```bash
chmod -x /path/to/file
```

To remove execute permissions for all files with a specific extension, you can use a command like this:

```bash
find /path/to/game/server/root -type f -name '*.cfg' -exec chmod -x {} \;
```

To fix this issue on all new game servers, update the permissions in `/home/tcadmin/tcafiles/games/gamefolder`.

Another option is to set the value of `RestrictLinuxExe` to `False` in the server's `Override.config`. If you do this, it is recommended to use the game's File System Permissions to hide important files like the startup script and main binary.

## Open Game Server Ports When Service Is Created (firewalld)

**Q7.** How can I open game server ports when a service is created using firewalld?

**A7.** To open game server ports automatically when a service is created using firewalld, you can configure a global game script for the game server's after-created event. Use the following commands as an example:

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=${ThisService_GamePort}/tcp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=${ThisService_GamePort}/udp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=${ThisService_QueryPort}/tcp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=${ThisService_QueryPort}/udp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=${ThisService_RConPort}/tcp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=${ThisService_RConPort}/udp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

These commands will add the specified ports to the firewalld configuration, making them accessible for the game server service when it is created.
