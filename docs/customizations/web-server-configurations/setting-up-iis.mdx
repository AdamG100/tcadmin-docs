# Setting up IIS with TCAdmin

## Install IIS with Support for ASP.NET 4.0/4.5 Development

1. Install IIS on your system with support for ASP.NET 4.0/4.5 development.

## Set up SQLite Database

1. Copy `TCAdmin2\Monitor\sqlite3.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32` if you are using an SQLite database.

## Configure IIS

1. Add the user `TCAWeb` to the `IIS_IUSRS` group.

2. Manually create a website in IIS Manager:

   - Web root: `Program Files\TCAdmin2\ControlPanel.MVC`
   - Application pool: `.NET v4.5`

3. In IIS Manager, right-click on the created website and select "Add Application":

   - Name: `Aspx` (case-sensitive)
   - Web root: `Program Files\TCAdmin2\ControlPanel`
   - Application pool: `.NET v4.5`

4. Select the website in IIS Manager:

   - Click on "Basic Settings"
   - Under "Connect as...", enter the user and password of the Windows user that runs your website.
   - Ensure this user has full permissions on the following folders:
     - ControlPanel
     - ControlPanel.MVC
     - Cache
     - Temp
     - Logs
     - Database
     - Read permissions on Monitor\Shared

5. If using TCAWeb, start the monitor in console mode and execute `tcaweb-pass` to obtain the password or attach `TCAdmin2\Monitor\TCAWeb.config` to a support ticket for assistance.

6. Configure the `Aspx` application to run with the same user as the main website.

7. If using Let's Encrypt, bind the website to a specific IP and hostname to prevent TCAdmin from changing the website's certificate.

8. Give full permissions to `IIS APPPOOL\.NET v4.5` on the following folders:
   - C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\Cache
   - C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\Temp
   - C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\Logs\Web
   - C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\ControlPanel
   - C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\ControlPanel.MVC
   - C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\Database

## Database Configuration

1. Execute the following command on your database to disable the built-in web server:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM tc_server_enabled_components WHERE module_id = '07405876-e8c2-4b24-a774-4ef57f596384' AND component_id = 2 AND server_id = 1;
   ```

2. If you need to enable the built-in web server again, use the following command:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tc_server_enabled_components (module_id, component_id, server_id) values ('07405876-e8c2-4b24-a774-4ef57f596384', 2, 1);
   ```

## Disable Output Caching

1. Disable output caching to prevent issues with user sessions:
   - Open IIS Manager
   - Select your website
   - Double click on "Output Caching"
   - Under Actions on the right side, click on "Edit Feature Settings"
   - Uncheck "Enable Cache" and "Enable kernel cache"
   - Click OK

## Configure IIS with Multiple Worker Processes

1. Follow the instructions above to disable the built-in web server.

2. Start the ASP.NET state service and set the startup to Automatic:

   - Go to Start > Administrative Tools > Services

3. Edit `TCAdmin2\ControlPanel\Web.config` and `TCAdmin2\ControlPanel.MVC\Web.config`:

   - Replace `<sessionState timeout="30"/>` with `<sessionState mode="StateServer" stateConnectionString="tcpip=localhost:42424" cookieless="false" timeout="30" />`

4. Open IIS Manager and select the advanced properties of the .NET Application pool. Increase the number of worker processes as needed.
