# Game Switcher Scripting Variables

These variables are available in the before game switch and after game switch events.

- `SwitchGameFrom` - If the game server is being switched to a new game, this value is the current game id.

- `SwitchGameTo` - If the game server is being switched to a new game, this value is the new game id.

## Examples

```bash title="Windows batch script"
@echo off
echo Switching from game id %SwitchGameFrom% to %SwitchGameTo%
```

```bash title="Linux shell script"
echo Switching from game id $SwitchGameFrom to $SwitchGameTo
```

```py title="IronPython script"
 Script.WriteToConsole("Switching from game id " + str(SwitchGameFrom) + " to " + str(SwitchGameTo))
```
