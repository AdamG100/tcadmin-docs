# Open and close ports in Windows firewall

If you enable support for Windows firewall in TCAdmin it will add the game server's executable to the firewall exceptions. If the game server is started with a .bat this will not work. You can set a custom batch script for the after created event that opens the game server's ports or adds the correct executable and a script for the after deleted event that closes the ports.

## To open the game server's game, query and rcon ports

```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=%ThisService_GamePort%
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=%ThisService_QueryPort%
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=%ThisService_RConPort%
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=%ThisService_GamePort%
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=%ThisService_QueryPort%
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=%ThisService_RConPort%
```

## To add the game server's executable to the firewall exceptions

Replace MyGame.exe with the correct relative path and filename.

```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%" dir=in action=allow program="%ThisService_RootDirectory%MyGame.exe" enable=yes
```

## To close the game server's ports or remove the executable

```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="%ThisService_ConnectionInfo%"
```
