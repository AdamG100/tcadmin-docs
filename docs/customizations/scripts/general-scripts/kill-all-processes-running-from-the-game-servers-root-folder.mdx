# Kill all processes running from the game server's root folder

These batch/shell scripts kill all running processes located in the game server's root directory and sub directories. You can configure it on the after stopped event.

* Windows
```
set exelocation=%ThisService_RootDirectory:\=\\%
wmic path win32_process where "ExecutablePath like '%%%exelocation%%%'" call terminate
```

* Linux
```
#!/bin/bash

# Remove any trailing slash from the directory path for consistency
ThisService_RootDirectory=${ThisService_RootDirectory%/}

# Loop through all process IDs
for pid in $(ps -eo pid --no-headers); do
    # Get the executable path of the process using the /proc filesystem
    exe=$(readlink /proc/$pid/exe)
    # Check if the executable path was retrieved successfully (not empty)
    if [ -n "$exe" ]; then
        # Extract the directory of the executable
        exe_dir=$(dirname "$exe")
        # Check if the executable's directory is the specified directory or a subdirectory
        if [[ $exe_dir == $ThisService_RootDirectory || $exe_dir == $ThisService_RootDirectory/* ]]; then
            # Terminate the process
            kill $pid
        fi
    fi
done
```

This Windows batch script kills a specific process located in the game server's root directory.

```
set executable=%ThisService_RootDirectory%CustomExe.exe
wmic path win32_process where "ExecutablePath like '%executable:\=\\%'" call terminate
``
