## Examples

### Get a list of services that are currently running:

```sql showLineNumbers
SELECT a.ip_address, a.game_port, b.*
FROM tc_game_services a, tc_game_service_live_stats b
WHERE online = 1 AND a.service_id = b.service_id;
```

### Get the total number of players connected on each server:

```sql showLineNumbers
SELECT a.display_name, sum(b.players) as players
FROM tc_servers a, tc_game_service_live_stats b, tc_services c
WHERE c.server_id=a.server_id AND b.service_id=c.service_id AND b.online=1 
GROUP BY a.server_id;
```

### Get the total RAM assigned to Minecraft/Craftbukkit services per server. The results are ordered from lowest to highest.

```sql showLineNumbers
SELECT a.server_id ,a.display_name, ROUND(SUM(b.memory_limit)/1024/1024, 0) AS memory_limit_mb
FROM tc_servers a, tc_game_service_live_stats b, tc_services c
WHERE c.server_id=a.server_id AND b.service_id=c.service_id
GROUP BY a.server_id
ORDER BY SUM(b.memory_limit) ASC
```
