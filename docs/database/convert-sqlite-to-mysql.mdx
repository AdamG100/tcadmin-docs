# Convert SQLite Database to MySQL

## Convert your Database

You can convert your SQLite database to MySQL using the tool available at `General Settings` > `Tools`.

- Install MySQL on your master server.
- Create an empty MySQL database and user.
- Go to `General Settings` > `Tools.` Select `Convert SQLite Database to MySQL`.
- Enter the required information and click on Execute.
- After the process completes run the configuration utility and configure TCAdmin to use the MySQL database and restart. [http://x.x.x.x:8880/Interface/Config/Default](http://x.x.x.x:8880/Interface/Config/Default) for MVC and [http://x.x.x.x:8880/Interface/Configuration/Default.aspx](http://x.x.x.x:8880/Interface/Configuration/Default.aspx) for ASP.NET

:::tip
If you get an error about missing tables uninstall any modules that you have installed. Then install them again after converting the database successfully.

## Configure Remote Servers

After you have configured your master it is recommended that you enable remote db connections. Go to `Server Management` > `Remote DB Connections`. Enter the information required to connect to the database there.

Generate a new `ConfigUtility.config` for each of your remote servers. Place it in the remote's Monitor folder (`/home/tcadmin/Monitor` or `Program Files\TCAdmin2\Monitor`) and restart the monitor. It is recommended that you start the monitor in [console mode](/getting-started/server-components#startstop-in-console-mode) first to make sure it connects to the database correctly.
